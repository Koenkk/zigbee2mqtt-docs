## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold the setup button on the rear of the device for +- 10 seconds (until the green light goes solid)
to initiate pairing. Please note that the pairing indicator light is below the main sensor
(as oppose to the obvious indicator above the main sensor).

This specific device has been reported to have issues repairing to a Zigbee network after upgrading from a CC2531 to a CC2652 controller (Zigbee 1.2 to 3.0). (Re)pairing may only work after pairing the device to another network and channel first (has been tested with a Philips Hue 2.0 hub in this instance) before pairing it back to the Zigbee2MQTT network again.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `illuminance_lux_precision`: Controls the precision of `illuminance_lux` values, e.g. `0` or `1`; default `1`.
To control the precision based on the illuminance_lux value set it to e.g. `{1000: 0, 100: 1}`,
when illuminance_lux >= 1000 precision will be 0, when illuminance_lux >= 100 precision will be 1.


* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate illuminance values,
e.g. `95` would take 95% to the illuminance reported by the device; default `100`.


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


### Motion sensitivity
The motion sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`
`{"motion_sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITIVITY` is one of the following
values: `low`,  `medium`,  `high` (default).

### Occupancy timeout
Sets the sensors timeout between last motion detected and sensor reports occupance false
```js
{
    // Value >= 0,
    // 0 - 10: 10sec (min possible timeout)
    //   > 10: timeout in sec
    // (must be written to (default) endpoint 2)
    "occupancy_timeout": 0,
}
```


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
