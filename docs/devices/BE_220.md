# Innr BE 220

| Model | BE 220  |
| Vendor  | Innr  |
| Description | E26/E24 white bulb |
| Supports | on/off, brightness |
| Picture | ![Innr BE 220](../images/devices/BE-220.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zkpZSv84H4)).

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    color_temp: false
    xy: false
    hs: false
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254
    effect: true
    effect_list: 
      - "blink"
      - "breathe"
      - "okay"
      - "channel_change"
      - "finish_effect"
      - "stop_effect"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
