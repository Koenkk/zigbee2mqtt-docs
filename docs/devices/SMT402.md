# Stelpro Maestro SMT402

| Model | SMT402 |
| Vendor  | Stelpro |
| Description | Zigbee line volt thermostat |
| Supports | local temp, local humidity, keypad lockout, mode, state, outdoor temp |
| Picture | ![Stelpro Maestro SMT402](../images/devices/SMT402.jpg) |

## Notes

To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: auto_publish_outdoor_temp
  description: publish the outdoor temperature to Stelpro thermostat
  trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.outdoor_sensor_temperature
  condition: []
  action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data_template:
      payload: '{{ states(trigger.entity_id) }}'
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/THERMOSTAT_FRIENDLY_NAME/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature'
```

**IMPORTANT**: The outdoor temperature need to be refreshed at least each 4 hours, or the `EXT` display will be cleared on the thermostat.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    action_topic: "operation"
    min_temp: "5"
    max_temp: "30"
    modes: 
      - "off"
      - "auto"
      - "heat"
    mode_state_topic: true
    mode_state_template: "{{ value_json.system_mode }}"
    mode_command_topic: true
    current_temperature_topic: true
    current_temperature_template: "{{ value_json.local_temperature }}"
    temperature_state_topic: true
    temperature_state_template: "{{ value_json.occupied_heating_setpoint }}"
    temperature_command_topic: "occupied_heating_setpoint"
    temp_step: 0.5

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

lock:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/keypad_lockout"
    payload_unlock: "0"
    payload_lock: "1"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.keypad_lockout }}"
```
{% endraw %}
