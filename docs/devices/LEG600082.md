Example of MQTT message payload to disable permanent LED and enable LED when the lights are on. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "permanent_led": "OFF",
    "led_when_on": "ON"
}
```

### Identify

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:

    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the switch. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness, color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`


## Exposes

### Light
This light supports the following features: `state`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

#### Transition
For all of the above mentioned features it is possible to do a transition of the value over time. To do this add an additional property `transition` to the payload which is the transition time in seconds.
Examples: `{"brightness":156,"transition":3}`, `{"color_temp":241,"transition":1}`.

### Permanent_led (binary)
Enable or disable the permanent blue LED.
Value can be found in the published state on the `permanent_led` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"permanent_led": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` permanent_led is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Led_when_on (binary)
Enables the LED when the light is on.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_when_on` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_when_on": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` led_when_on is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
