## Notes


### Pairing

While pairing, keep the valve close to the coordinator.

1. *Turn the display on*: Short press home (:house:).
2. *Enter settings*: Long press home (:house:) for 3sec.
3. *Select WiFi settings*: Press the plus button (:heavy_plus_sign:) button 4 times to see the digital **`5`** on the right hand side and the blinking WiFi logo.
4. *Enter WiFi settings*: Press home (:house:) once again. Now only WiFi logo is showing without blinking.
5. *Enable pairing mode*: Long press home (:house:). WiFi logo is now blinking.
6. *Keep display on*: Touch home (:house:) every few seconds.

### Local temperature
If you'd like to force device to send local_temperature you can use this mqtt command:
* `topic`: zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set/local_temperature_calibration
* `payload`: YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE

YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE can be 0, but if you calibrated temperature for this device send current value.
After this command thermostat responds with two messages. One for calibration change confirmation, and other with current local_temperature.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
