# Xiaomi ZNCZ04LM

| Model | ZNCZ04LM  |
| Vendor  | Xiaomi  |
| Description | Mi power plug ZigBee EU |
| Supports | on/off, power measurement |
| Picture | ![Xiaomi ZNCZ04LM](../images/devices/ZNCZ04LM.jpg) |

## Notes


### Power outage memory
This option allows the device to restore the last on/off state when it's reconnected to power.
To set this option publish to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set` payload `{"power_outage_memory": true}` (or `false`).
Now toggle the plug/switch once with the button on it, from now on it will restore its state when reconnecting to power.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
