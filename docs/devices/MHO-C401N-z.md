## Notes
Originally this device does not support Zigbee (only Bluetooth).
To use this device with Zigbee2MQTT a custom firmware has to be flashed which is explained [here](https://github.com/pvvx/ZigbeeTLc).
This firmware converts the device from Bluetooth to Zigbee.
Requires firmware v0.1.2.1 or newer!
