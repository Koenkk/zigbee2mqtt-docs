## Notes


### Installing the TRV
- open battery cover (twist and slide)
- insert batteries (a orange wrench should appear)
- close battery cover (slide and twist)
- press front button until `F1₁` is displayed
- install TRV
- press front button until `F1₂` is displayed (after 10-30 seconds the TRV should be able to pair)

### Pairing
- press front button 3x to enter pairing mode (LED will flash green)

If you get a warning that the model is undefined, which might happen after removing the device. Try removing it from the network again while in pairning mode.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
