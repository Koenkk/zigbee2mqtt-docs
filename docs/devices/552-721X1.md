## Notes

### Pairing
Remove the cover and press the little button 3x, the led will flash blue when in pairing mode. The device stays in this mode for 5 minutes or until it succesfully paired.

### Binding
The manual metions the button can be decoupled, however this does not seem to follow the Zigbee Specifications and it's not possible to simple unbind and bind the endpoints using zigbee2mqtt. Perhaps in the future this will be possible if someone can sniff what the Niko Home Control hub does to configure this behavior.

### LED
| off | normal operation, the load is off |
| white continues | normal operation, the load is on |
| red flashing | connection to the zigbee network lost |
| blue flashing | connecting to the zigbee network |
| blue continues for 4 sec | connected succesfulyl to the zigbee network |

The LED can be disabled while the load is on by using a toothpick and holding the **PROG** button for 10 seconds.
