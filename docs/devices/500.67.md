## Notes


### Pairing
- Press W-key for 3 seconds
- Press Power On/Off Key for 5 seconds
- Press Power On/Off again for 3 seconds
Now the device should showup.

### Extended hue
The device gives extended hue values. Zigbee2MQTT calculates also the normal hue and provides both via mqtt.
- hue = extendedhue * 360 / 65536 % 360


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
