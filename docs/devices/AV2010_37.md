| Description | Wireless motion detector |
| Exposes | occupancy, battery_low, tamper, linkquality |
| Picture | ![SMaBiT AV2010/37](../images/devices/AV2010-37.jpg) |

## Notes


## Pairing
Press and hold the function key for about 10 seconds until you hear a short beep. 
During the search, the LED lights up red once every 10 seconds. When the LED flashes 2 times, the device has successfully registered.


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `occupancy_timeout`: Timeout (in seconds) after which the `occupancy: false` message is sent.
If not set, the timeout is `90` seconds.
When set to `0` no `occupancy: false` is sent.



## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"

    payload_off: false
    device_class: "motion"
