## Notes


### Binding
By default the switch is bound to the coordinator but this device can also be used to directly control other lights and switches in the network.

First unbind it from the coordinator, then you can bind it to any other device or group. (see https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/binding.html )

Now change the operation mode of the device, by default it is in `event` mode, but when binding we need to change it to `command` mode.
To do this send to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload `{"operation_mode": "command"}`, right before doing this make sure to wakeup the device.

As the device is sleeping by default, you need to wake it up after sending the bind/unbind command by pressing the reset button once.

When bound to a lamp, the behavior is as follows (for WXCJKG11LM Aqara Opple switch 1 band):
- left click: turn off
- right click: turn on
- left double click: light dim down (by steps of 33%)
- right double click: light dim up (by steps of 33%)
- long left click: warm white
- long right click: cold white


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
