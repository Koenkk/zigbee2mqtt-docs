## Notes


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


* `humidity_precision`: Controls the precision of `humidity` values, e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
