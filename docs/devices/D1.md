## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device.
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load.

### Ballast Configuration
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` the dimmer's ballast configuration attributes (`min_level` and `max_level`) can be set.
Example:
```json
{
    "ballast_config": {
        "min_level": 3
    }
}
```

By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/ballast_config` the values of the ballast configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).
To account for errors due to missing optional attributes (since this is a general function), every cluster attribute will be queried separately and the complete process can therefore take a moment.

### Dimmer strategy configuration
The dimmer phase control mode can be changed by publishing `{ "mode_phase_control": "MODE" }` to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` where `MODE` is one of the following values: `automatic` (default), `forward` or `reverse`.

A word of caution is in order: configuring the wrong dimmer phase control mode could destory the device or the attached load!

More information can be found in the [ubisys D1 technical reference manual](https://www.smarthome-store.de/media/documents/ubisys-d1-technical-reference.pdf), chapter "7.2.8. Dimmer Setup Cluster (Server)".

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes
### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.
#### Transition
For all of the above mentioned features it is possible to do a transition of the value over time. To do this add an additional property `transition` to the payload which is the transition time in seconds.
Examples: `{"brightness":156,"transition":3}`, `{"color_temp":241,"transition":0.5}`.
#### Moving/stepping
Instead of setting a value (e.g. brightness) directly it is also possible to:
- move: this will automatically move the value over time, to stop send value `stop` or `0`.
- step: this will increment/decrement the current value by the given one.

The direction of move and step can be either up or down, provide a negative value to move/step down, a positive value to move/step up.
To do this send a payload like below to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`

**NOTE**: brightness move/step will stop at the minimum brightness and won't turn on the light when it's off. In this case use `brightness_move_onoff`/`brightness_step_onoff`
````js
{
  "brightness_move": -40, // Starts moving brightness down at 40 units per second
  "brightness_move": 0, // Stop moving brightness
  "brightness_step": 40 // Increases brightness by 40
}
````

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

### Dimmer Capabilities: Forward phase control (binary)

Indicates if the dimmer supports AC forward phase control.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"capabilities_forward_phase_control": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Capabilities: Reverse phase control (binary)

Indicates if the dimmer supports AC reverse phase control.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"capabilities_reverse_phase_control": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Capabilities: Reactance discriminator (binary)

Indicates if the dimmer is capable of measuring the reactanceto distinguish inductive and capacitive loads.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"capabilities_reactance_discriminator": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Capabilities: Configurable curve (binary)

Indicates if the dimmer is capable of replacing the built-in, default dimming curve.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"capabilities_configurable_curve": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Capabilities: Overload detection (binary)

Indicates if the dimmer is capable of detecting an output overload and shutting the output off.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"capabilities_overload_detection": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Status: Forward phase control (binary)

Indicates that the dimmer is currently operating in AC forward phase control mode.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"status_forward_phase_control": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Status: Reverse phase control (binary)

Indicates that the dimmer is currently operating in AC reverse phase control mode.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"status_reverse_phase_control": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Status: Overload (binary)

Indicates that the output is currently turned off, because the dimmer has detected an overload.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"status_overload": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Status: Capacitive load (binary)

Indicates that the dimmer's reactance discriminator had detected a capacitive load.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"status_capacitive_load": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"status_inductive_load": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.

### Dimmer Mode: Phase control (enum)

Configures the dimming technique.

The possible values are: `automatic`, `forward` and `reverse`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
