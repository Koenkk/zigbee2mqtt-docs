# Ubisys D1

## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device.
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load.

### Ballast Configuration
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` the dimmer's ballast configuration attributes (`min_level` and `max_level`) can be set.
Example:
```json
{
    "ballast_config": {
        "min_level": 3
    }
}
```

By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/ballast_config` the values of the ballast configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).
To account for errors due to missing optional attributes (since this is a general function), every cluster attribute will be queried separately and the complete process can therefore take a moment.

### Dimmer strategy configuration
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` the dimmer strategy configuration can be set. Supported values for the `mode` attibute are `automatic`, `forward` and `reverse`.
Example:
```json
{
    "ubisys_dimmer_setup": {
        "mode": "automatic"
    }
}
```

By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/ubisys_dimmer_setup` the values of the dimmer strategy configuration attributes can also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed). More information about the meaning of the returned bitmaps can be found in the [ubisys D1 technical reference manual](https://www.smarthome-store.de/media/documents/ubisys-d1-technical-reference.pdf), chapter "7.2.8. Dimmer Setup Cluster (Server)".

* Capabilities Attribute

Bit(s) | Description
---|---
0 | When this bit is set, the dimmer supports AC forward phase control.
1 | When this bit is set, the dimmer supports AC reverse phase control.
2..4 | These bits are reserved for future use and must be written as 0 and ignored when read.
5 | When this bit is set, the dimmer is capable of measuring the reactance of the attached ballast good enough to distinguish inductive and capacitive loads and select the appropriate dimming technique accordingly.
6 | When this bit is set, the dimmer is capable of replacing the built-in, default dimming curve, with a curve that better suits the attached ballast
7 | When this bit is set, the dimmer is capable of detecting an output overload and shutting the output off to prevent damage to the dimmer.

* Status Attribute

Bit(s) | Description
---|---
0 | When this bit is set, the dimmer is currently operating in AC forward phase control mode.
1 | When this bit is set, the dimmer is currently operating in AC reverse phase control.
2 | This bit is reserved for future use and must be written as 0 and ignored when read.
3 | The output is currently turned off, because the dimmer has detected an overload.
4..5 | Reserved for future use. Set to 0 when writing, ignore when reading.
6 | When this bit is set, the dimmer's reactance discriminator had detected a capacitive load
7 | When this bit is set, the dimmer's reactance discriminator had detected an inductive load

* Mode Attribute

Bit(s) | Description
---|---
0..1 | Specifies the mode of operation:<br>00b: Automatically select the appropriate dimming technique<br>01b: Always use forward phase control (leading edge, L)<br>10b: Always use reverse phase control (trailing edge, C/R)<br>11b: Reserved. Do not use.
2..7 | These bits are reserved for future use. Write as 0, ignore when reading.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes
### Light 
This light supports the following features: `state`, `brightness`.
- `state`: To control the state publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`. To read the state send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
- `brightness`: To control the brightness publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"brightness": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `254`. To read the brightness send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"brightness": ""}`.
#### Transition
For all of the above mentioned features it is possible to do a transition of the value over time. To do this add an additional property `transition` to the payload which is the transition time in seconds.
Examples: `{"brightness":156,"transition":3}`, `{"color_temp":241,"transition":0.5}`.
#### Moving/stepping
Instead of setting a value (e.g. brightness) directly it is also possible to:
- move: this will automatically move the value over time, to stop send value `stop` or `0`.
- step: this will increment/decrement the current value by the given one.

The direction of move and step can be either up or down, provide a negative value to move/step down, a positive value to move/step up.
To do this send a payload like below to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`

**NOTE**: brightness move/step will stop at the minimum brightness and won't turn on the light when it's off. In this case use `brightness_move_onoff`/`brightness_step_onoff`
````js
{
  "brightness_move": -40, // Starts moving brightness down at 40 units per second
  "brightness_move": 0, // Stop moving brightness
  "brightness_step": 40 // Increases brightness by 40
}
````

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
