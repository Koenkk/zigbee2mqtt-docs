# Schneider Electric EER50000

| Model | EER50000  |
| Vendor  | Schneider Electric  |
| Description | Wiser H-Relay (HACT) |
| Exposes | ## climate (occupied_heating_setpoint, local_temperature), linkquality |## WRONG !
| Picture | ![Schneider Electric EER50000](../images/devices/EER50000.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
factory reset the device by pressing 10sec. on reset
next press set bouton one time the orange led will blink

warning z2m configuration file must bez modified ... (by changing this all devices wil need to be re-paired)
Channel: 15, 11 

Extended PANID: must finish by  484504015E10

ex : 
advanced:
  pan_id: 6754 (in Hex 0x4336)
  ext_pan_id_string: 67, 54, 72, 69, 4, 1, 94, 16 (0x4336484504015E10)
  
use a hex to decimal to convert (like :https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html)

## Exposes

#### must be modified !! exposes are wrong ! it is not an climate but an heater actuator, it work mostly like the CCTFR6700

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `7` and `30`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    temperature_unit: "C"
    temp_step: 0.5
    min_temp: "7"
    max_temp: "30"
    current_temperature_topic: true
    current_temperature_template: "{{ value_json.local_temperature }}"
    temperature_command_topic: "occupied_heating_setpoint"
    temperature_state_template: "{{ value_json.occupied_heating_setpoint }}"
    temperature_state_topic: true

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    enabled_by_default: false
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    state_class: "measurement"
```
{% endraw %}
