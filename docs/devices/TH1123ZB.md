## Notes


### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
```

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

``` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature
  description: Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      payload_template: '{{ states(''sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor'') | string }}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
    service: mqtt.publish
```

### Enabling time
To enable _time_ you need to send a _blank_ message to the following MQTT topic:
```
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
```
Everytime the above message is sent, Zigbee2mqtt will calculate the current time and send it to the thermostat.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
