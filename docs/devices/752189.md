    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    device_class: "battery"

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"
