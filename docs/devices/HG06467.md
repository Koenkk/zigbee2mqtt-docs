## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the LED string by holding the "F" button for 5 seconds.
When you let go of the button the LED string should blink slowly
After resetting the LED string will automatically connect.

While pairing, keep the string close to the CC2531 USB sniffer.


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `effect`: Controls the 16 build-in effects of the LED string.
An effect expects 3 parameters: `speed`, `colors` and `effect`
  * `speed` should be a number between 1 and 100.
  * `colors` is an array of json objects containing `r`, `g`, `b`. Note: some effects support multiple colors
  * `effect` is a string, below is a list of possible values and the amount of colors it supports
```
|     effect             |     # colors    |

#### Example json structure of an effect
```json
{
    "effect": {
        "effect": "snake",
        "speed": 100,
        "colors": [
            {
                "r": 255,
                "g": 0,
                "b": 0
            },
            {
                "r": 0,
                "g": 255,
                "b": 0
            },
            {
                "r": 0,
                "g": 0,
                "b": 255
            },
        ]
    }
}
```


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    color_temp: false
    xy: false
    hs: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
