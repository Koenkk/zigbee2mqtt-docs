## Notes


### Pairing
For the OSRAM Smart+ Switch Mini (AC0251100NJ/AC0251700NJ) hold the Middle and Arrow Down Buttons for 10 Seconds
to Reset the Device. Hold the Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to connect.
If the Switch is connected hold Middle and Arrow Up Buttons for 3 Seconds to disconnect.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)

### Groups and pairing
By default this switch sends commands to group 0, which is the default group. For me it meant that it switched all lights in my Zigbee network! Once you pair it with another group or device it stops sending to the default group, which probably means that it can only be paired to one partner.
One thing to look out for is that the device has three endpoints, one for each switch. You have to pair all three individually to the new group or device, otherwise only the "up" button will send commands to the paired device, the other switches will still send commands to all lights in the network. So for me I had to send these MQTT commands (here using mosquitto):
```
# mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind" -h IP_ADDRESS -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/1", "to": "DEVICE_OR_GROUP"}'
# mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind" -h IP_ADDRESS -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/2", "to": "DEVICE_OR_GROUP"}'
# mosquitto_pub -t "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind" -h IP_ADDRESS -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/3", "to": "DEVICE_OR_GROUP"}'
```


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).
## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `up`, `up_hold`, `up_release`, `down_release`, `circle_release`, `circle_hold`, `down`, `down_hold`, `circle_click`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.action }}"
    icon: "mdi:gesture-double-tap"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    icon: "mdi:signal"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:update"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['update']['state'] }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
