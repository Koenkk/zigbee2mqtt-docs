Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_range` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"detection_range": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"detection_range": NEW_VALUE}`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Motion sensitivity (enum)
Different sensitivities means different static human body recognition rate and response speed of occupied.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_sensitivity` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": ""}`.
