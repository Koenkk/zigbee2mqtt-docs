## Notes


### Pairing
* Install the device on the valve. Insert the batteries (and M will display).
* Push the "o" button for 5 seconds to calibrate the valve motor.
* Push the "o" button for briefly to enter Pairing mode (can take upto 60 seconds).

To factory reset:
* Remove one battery.
* Press and hold "o" button.
* Insert battery and hold button pressed for about 3 seconds (display will flash all symbols).

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `keypad_lockout` property (value is `1` or `0`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keypad_lockout": "1"}` or `{"keypad_lockout": "0"}`.
To read the current state of this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"keypad_lockout": ""}`.

### Mounted_mode (binary)
Mode in which the unit is mounted. This is set to `false` for normal mounting or `true` for vertical mounting.
Value can be found in the published state on the `mounted_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` mounted_mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Heat_required (binary)
Wether or not the unit needs warm water.
Value can be found in the published state on the `heat_required` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` heat_required is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Window_open_internal (binary)
Most likely related to the option to set Window Detection mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_open_internal` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `1` window_open_internal is ON, if `0` OFF.

### Setpoint_change_source (binary)
Values observed are `0` (set locally) or `2` (set via Zigbee).
Value can be found in the published state on the `setpoint_change_source` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `0` setpoint_change_source is ON, if `1` OFF.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `pi_heating_demand`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `6` and `28`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration

manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
