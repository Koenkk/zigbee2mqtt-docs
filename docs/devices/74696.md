## Notes


### Set default power on/off transition
Various Osram/Sylvania LED support setting a default transition when turning a light on and off.
```js
{
    "set_transition": 0.1,            //time in seconds (integer or float)
}
```

### Remember current light state
Various Osram/Sylvania LED support remembering their current state in case of power loss, or if a light
is manually switched off then on. Lights will remember their respective attributes
(i.e. brightness, color, saturation, etc.).
NOTE: This must be executed every time you make changes to a light's attributes for it to then 'remember' it.
```js
{
    "remember_state": true,            // true, false (boolean)
}
```

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `transition`: Controls the transition time (in seconds) of on/off, brightness,
color temperature (if applicable) and color (if applicable) changes. Defaults to `0` (no transition).
Note that this value is overridden if a `transition` value is present in the MQTT command payload.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
light:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    brightness: true
    color_temp: false
    xy: false
    hs: false
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    brightness_scale: 254
    effect: true
    effect_list: 
      - "blink"
      - "breathe"
      - "okay"
      - "channel_change"
      - "finish_effect"
      - "stop_effect"

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    icon: "mdi:signal"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
