## Notes
### Warning!

The device has a potentially deathly flaw.
The mains power supply is based on a simple buck converter 
where neutral of the mains input is referencing GND on the sensor connector.

This device should only be powered by an isolated power supply via the micro-USB port.

### Temperature and Humidity sensing

The device comes in bundles with what looks like a DHT-22
and a DS18B20 style temperature probe is also offered in a bundle.
