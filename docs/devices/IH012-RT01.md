## Notes
LED diode can be removed without damaging the device, simply dissasemble it by removing battery and pushing down on the dome until it pops out, then pry the LED diode off the pcb


### Pairing
To start pairing, press the button (pinhole on the side of the device) using a
pin/paperclip for approx. 10 seconds. The led will turn on, then start blinking while the
pairing process is in progress.

### Reading and Setting Values

As a low power device, the motion sensor isn't reachable most of the time, but
only when active (e.g. because it detected motion). Therefore, requests to read
or set values (i.e. `sensitivity` or `keep_time`) won't be processed right away,
typically. Instead, they will be queued and sent on the next occasion.

## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Sensitivity (enum)
PIR sensor sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `sensitivity` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"sensitivity": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high`.

### Keep_time (enum)
PIR keep time in seconds.
Value can be found in the published state on the `keep_time` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"keep_time": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keep_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `30`, `60`, `120`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
