## Notes


### Pairing

Press the side button of the device with a paper clip for more than 2 seconds. The main button led will flash. Then make sure the device is awake during pairing phase or the configuration may fail. To ensure device is awake press the main button every 2 seconds until configuration is done in zigbee2mqtt logs.

### Important
There are 3 versions of this device: Standalone, Zigbee and Z-wave. These are visualy identical. Make sure to get the correct version that will work with zigbee2mqtt:

Supported:
- **HS1SA-M : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-N : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-E : Zigbee 3.0**

Unsupported:
- HS1SA : Standalone
- HS1SA-Z : Z-wave

The product code should end in *-M* for the Zigbee version. The label inside the battery compartment should also show the Zigbee logo.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.smoke }}"
    device_class: "smoke"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery_low}}"
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
