## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"

    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery }}"
    device_class: "battery"

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
