# IKEA E1525/E1745

| Model | E1525/E1745  |
| Vendor  | IKEA  |
| Description | TRADFRI motion sensor |
| Exposes | battery, occupancy, requested_brightness_level, requested_brightness_percent, linkquality |
| Picture | ![IKEA E1525/E1745](../images/devices/E1525-E1745.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the sensor to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button 4 times in a row.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times and the turn off.
After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off.

### Binding
The E1745 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).


## Detection cooldown (E1745 version)
This device will pause detection of presence for approximately 1 min 37 sec after detection. In other words; with continuous detection, every 1:37 a new publish (occupancy: true) will be done.
Cooldown of detection is 3 min. In other words; 3 min after last published detection (and trigger no longer present) occupancy will be published as false.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Exposes
### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Requested_brightness_level (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_level` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Requested_brightness_percent (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_percent` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml

  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
