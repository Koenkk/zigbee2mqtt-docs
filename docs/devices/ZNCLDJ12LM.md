## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
cover:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    set_position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    set_position_template: "{ \"position\": {{ position }} }"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.position }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
