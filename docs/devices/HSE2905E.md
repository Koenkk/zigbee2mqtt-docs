# Datek Eva HAN

| Model | HSE2905E  |
| Vendor  | Datek  |

| Exposes | power, energy, current, voltage, current_phase_b, voltage_phase_b, current_phase_c, voltage_phase_c, linkquality, temperature |
| Picture | ![Datek Eva Meter Reader](../images/devices/HSE2905E.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset by removing the plastic cover and press & hold the power button for 10 seconds. The LED is then 
starting to blink Red/Blue to indicate in pairing mode.

### Should automatically support (only tested Kamstrup)
- Aidon
- Kaifa
- Kamstrup

### Configuring interface mode
There should be no need to configure into any interface mode as the Eva HAN should autodetect the correct mode.

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. If firmware are < 0.4
either update fw via Eva Smart HUB or ask Datek for a replacement with min fw 0.4. Tested on 0.4.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
