## Notes


### Pairing
Plug the device in and wait for around 5mins, while it performs its self-tests.
A successful self-test is indicated by couple of beeps and a steady green led.
Now the device is ready for pairing. To initiate pairing quickly press the button three times in a row.


### Sensitivity
The sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`
`{"sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITVITIY` is one of the following
values: `low`, `medium`,  `high`.

### Self-test
A self-test can be trigged by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/[FRIENDLY_NAME]/set`
`{"selftest": ""}`.
If the selftest is executed succesfully you will hear the device beep in 30 seconds.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.gas }}"
    device_class: "gas"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.gas_density }}"
    icon: "mdi:google-circles-communities"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.sensitivity }}"
    icon: "mdi:filter-variant"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "-"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
```
{% endraw %}
