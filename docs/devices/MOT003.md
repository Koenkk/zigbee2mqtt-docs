# Hive MOT003

| Model | MOT003  |
| Vendor  | Hive  |
| Description | Motion sensor |
| Supports | occupancy, temperature, battery |
| Picture | ![Hive MOT003](../images/devices/MOT003.jpg) |

## Notes


### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"

    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.occupancy }}"
    device_class: "motion"
