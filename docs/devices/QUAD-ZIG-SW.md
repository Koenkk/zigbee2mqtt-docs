### Switch type
QUAD-ZIG-SW has two modes for the four inputs: Switch and multi-click.

Switch turns the input into an on/off switch like a lamp switch.
Multi-click allows the input to click multiple times. These are the different clicks:

- Single (button_X_single)
- Double (button_X_double)
- Triple (button_X_triple)
- Hold (button_X_hold)
- Release (button_X_release)

Since the device is battery powered, it will not switch mode until it's awake. Make sure to keep the device online when changing mode, by enabling the input with a click.
