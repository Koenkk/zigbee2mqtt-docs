| Description | Power switch S1 |
| Supports | on/off, power measurement |

## Notes


### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### Decoupling
You can decouple the switch input form the state, this allows you to control a group of lights using the switch without cutting the power to the bulbs.

By default the input is bound to itself, so we need to unbind it and then bind a zigbee group

```
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <switch_friendly_name>
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/bind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <group_name>
```

To restore the original behavior you unbind the group and rebind the device

```
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/unbind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <group_name>
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/bind/<switch_friendly_name>/2 -m <switch_friendly_name>
```



## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
switch:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    payload_on: "ON"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    icon: "mdi:flash"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.power }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
