## Notes


### Force read power
* `power`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get`:

```js
{
    "power"
}
```


### Power Alarm Configuration
* `power_alarm`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: `DISABLE` (default) / `integer` (in kwh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
```

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kwh. This should be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
```

When it reaches that value, the `power_alarm_active` binary_sensor will change to `true`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* `identify['effect']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `blink3`
    - `fixed`
    - `blinkgreen`
    - `blinkblue`

* `identify['color']`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in `effect`. Values:
    - `default`
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `blue`
    - `lightblue`
    - `yellow`
    - `pink`
    - `white`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This shouuld be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:

```js
{
    "identify": {
      "effect": "blink3",
      "color": "white"
    }
}
```



## Exposes

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power. Value can be found in the published state on the power property. To read (/get) the value publish a message to topic zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get with payload {"power": ""}. It's not possible to write (/set) this value. The unit of this value is W.

### Power_alarm_active (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the power_alarm_active property. It's not possible to read (/get) or write (/set) this value. If value equals true power_alarm_active is ON, if false OFF.

### Power_alarm (binary)
Enable/disable the power alarm. Value can be found in the published state on the power_alarm property. To read (/get) the value publish a message to topic zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get with payload {"power_alarm": ""}. To write (/set) a value publish a message to topic zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set with payload {"power_alarm": NEW_VALUE}. If value equals true power_alarm is ON, if false OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength). Value can be found in the published state on the linkquality property. It's not possible to read (/get) or write (/set) this value. The minimal value is 0 and the maximum value is 255. The unit of this value is lqi.
