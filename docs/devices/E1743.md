## Notes


### Binding
The E1743 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time.

Note that < zigbee2mqtt 1.4 automatically bound this device to group 99.
If you want to bind it to a different group you first have to unbind it from group 99.


### Pairing
Pair the switch to Zigbee2mqtt by pressing the pair button (found under the back cover next to the battery) 4 times in a row. The red light on the front side should flash a few times and the turn off (it's more visible to see the light from the back). After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possbile with the following configuration:
