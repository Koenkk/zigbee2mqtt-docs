# Flashing the firmware on the CC2538 MODULE
The CC2538 module needs to be flashed with a custom firmware. This firmware can be flashed with a JTAG programmer.
The programmer can be found on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20191108075039&SearchText=jlink+V8+jtag)

## Windows
1. Install SEGGER [J-Link Software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)

# How-to check the installed firmware version
Zigbee2MQTT will output the installed firmware version to the Zigbee2MQTT log on startup:
```
Zigbee2MQTT:info  2019-11-09T13:01:14: Coordinator firmware version: '{"type":"zStack30x","meta":{"transportrev":2,"product":2,"majorrel":2,"minorrel":7,"maintrel":2,"revision":20190425}}'
```

In the above example the version is `20190425`.
