- Limited range, ~30m line of sight
- Requires additional hardware to be flashed (CC debugger and downloader cable)
- Coordinator firmware: [Zigbee 1.2 (recommended)](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_Home_1.2/bin) and [Zigbee 3.0](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.0.x/bin)

### Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1
![CC26X2R1](../images/cc26x2r1.jpg)

- USB connected Zigbee adapter.
- Expensive but **very powerful** ($40), will easily handle networks of 100+ devices.
- Very good range
- Only available as a development board, therefore it is quite large
- Has an onboard flasher, no additional hardware required to flash
- Coordinator firmware: [Zigbee 3.0](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin) (use **CC26X2R1_*.zip**)
- Can be bought via [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1)
- [Flash via UNIFLASH](./flashing_via_uniflash.md)
- When migrating from another dongle (e.g. CC2531), make sure to modify your `pan_id` in your [configuration](configuration.md), otherwise Zigbee2MQTT won't start.
- Has UF.L connector for external antenna ([requires resoldering a tiny capacitor (moving C14 to C24)](http://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/zigbee-and-thread/f/158/t/880219?LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1-Antenna-CC26X2R1)) which could increase range even further.
- This device has two serial devices built in. Make sure you put the right serial device in the [configuration](configuration.md) or use auto detect if you only have one Texas Instruments CC devices connected to your system.

### Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-CC1352P-2
![CC1352P-2](../images/cc1352p2.jpg)

- USB connected Zigbee adapter.
- Expensive but **very powerful** ($50), will easily handle networks of 100+ devices.
- Very good range
- Only benefit compared to the CC26X2R1 is that it is capable of sub-1GHz  (for Zigbee2MQTT use-case this makes no difference)
- Has SMA connector for external antenna ([requires resoldering a tiny capacitor](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2162#issuecomment-570286663)) which could increase range even further.
- Only available as a development board, therefore it is quite large (it's larger than the CC26X2R1)
- Has an onboard flasher, no additional hardware required to flash
- Coordinator firmware: [Zigbee 3.0](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware/tree/master/coordinator/Z-Stack_3.x.0/bin) (use **CC1352P_2_*.zip**)
- Can be bought via [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC1352P)
- [Flash via UNIFLASH](./flashing_via_uniflash.md)
- When migrating from another dongle (e.g. CC2531), make sure to modify your `pan_id` in your [configuration](configuration.md), otherwise Zigbee2MQTT won't start.
- This device has two serial devices built in. Make sure you put the right serial device in the [configuration](configuration.md) or use auto detect if you only have one Texas Instruments CC devices connected to your system.

- USB connnected Zigbee adapter
- **Very powerful**, will easily handle networks of 100+ devices.
- Support is still **experimental**. ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/72))
- In case you are getting the following error: `Error: Failed to connect to the adapter (Error: SRSP - SYS - ping after 6000ms)` set the following in your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
serial:
  adapter: deconz
```

### ZiGate USB-TTL
![ZiGate USB-TTL](../images/zigate_usb_ttl.png)
