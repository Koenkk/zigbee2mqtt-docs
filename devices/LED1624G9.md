# IKEA LED1624G9

| Model | LED1624G9  |
| Vendor  | IKEA  |
| Description | TRADFRI LED bulb E27/E26 600 lumen, dimmable, color, opal white |
| Supports | on/off, brightness, color xy |
| Picture | ![../images/devices/LED1624G9.jpg](../images/devices/LED1624G9.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the light bulb ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npxOrPxVfe0)).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

While pairing, keep the bulb close the the CC2531 USB sniffer.

What works is to use (very) short “on’s” and a little bit longer “off’s”.
Start with bulb on, then off, and then 6 “on’s”, where you kill the light as soon as the bulb shows signs of turning on.


## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possbile with the following configuration:


### LED1624G9

    xy: true
    schema: "json"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
